Blast Radius is the subset of a system that can be impacted by an attack; the worst case impact of a failed experiment. Usually measured in customer impact (i.e. 10% of customers could be impacted), but may be expressed in hosts, services, or containers. When running chaos experiments, it is recommended to start with a blast radius that is very small, and as you build more confidence, increase the blast radius.
